					<p>Whale sharks are the third biggest creature in the ocean, they’re not aggressive and don't 
                    <br> threaten humans. In fact, researchers and divers often swim right next to them.</p>

					<p>The young whale sharks, called “pups” measure between 
                    <br> 40 - 60 cm at birth and weigh only 3 – 5 kg.</p>

					<p>Each whale shark has a unique pattern of spots and stripes, sort of like your fingerprints.
                    <br> These patterns help to keep track of their movements as they migrate through tropical waters.</p>

					<p>Like all sharks, whale sharks don’t have bones. Their skeletons are made of 
                    <br> cartilage—the same stuff found in human ears and noses.
