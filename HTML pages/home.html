			<h1>Animals Main <br> Types</h1>
			<div><p>
				Animals are fascinating creatures found everywhere, from towering trees to the vast depths 
				of the ocean. There are six main types of animals, each with its own unique characteristics. 
				Mammals, like dogs and elephants, have fur or hair and give birth to live babies. Birds, such 
				as sparrows and eagles, have feathers and most can fly. Fish, like goldfish and whales, live 
				underwater and breathe through gills. Amphibians, including frogs and salamanders, can live both 
				in water and on land. Reptiles, such as snakes and turtles, have scales and lay eggs on land. 
				Lastly, invertebrates like insects and spiders don't have backbones. Together, these animals 
				create a rich tapestry of life on Earth
